# ChocAnGUI - CS 200 Project+
 Repo to house my first Java GUI Application: ChocAn Terminal  
 A GUI was not required for this project, but I said "A GUI cant be hard to make, even if I've never made one before"  
 ... I was very wrong. Making a GUI with 0 experience is very hard, especially when I'm also using a sql database intertwined with a project for the first time. So, I am very proud with where this project is at.  
 Hopefully I'll get it done in time, or else we'll have to use the crummy command-line, gross.  
 
 # Details:
 This application simulates a terminal used by a health insurance company, Chocoholics Anonymous.  
 There are 3 users who can access the terminal: Managers, Providers, and Operators.  
 All these users must log in with a user ID and that ID's corresponding password, this input is then compared to a database to authenticate and let the user's have access.

 ~~If for some reason you want to look at this, clone and open in eclipse. This repository should have all dependencies necessary to just open it and have no errors~~
 My mistake, you will need to have JavaFX runtime, I do not know how to include it within the lib/ yet, working on it
