# ChocAnGUI 
 Repo to house my first Java GUI Application: ChocAn Terminal  
 I'll be taking a basic command line java application, and creating a GUI interface for it.   
 A GUI was not required for this project, but I said "A GUI cant be hard to make, even if I've never made one before"  
 ... I was very wrong.  
 
This GUI interpretation of this project was completely done on my own accord.

 # Details:
 This application simulates a terminal used by a health insurance company, Chocoholics Anonymous.  
 There are 3 users who can access the terminal: Managers, Providers, and Operators.  
 All these users must log in with a user ID and that ID's corresponding password, this input is then compared to a database to authenticate and let the user's have access. We're using a MySQL server for this application.

Completely functional for the scope of the project
 
 
 ~~If for some reason you want to look at this, clone and open in eclipse. This repository should have all dependencies necessary to just open it and have no errors~~  
 My mistake, you will need to have JavaFX runtime, and I do not recommend eclipse. If you're doing JavaFX, then Intellij is the way to go. Learned that the hard way
