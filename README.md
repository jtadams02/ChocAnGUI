# ChocAnGUI - CS 200 Project+
 Repo to house my first Java GUI Application: ChocAn Terminal  
 A GUI was not required for this project, but I said "A GUI cant be hard to make, even if I've never made one before"  
 ... I was very wrong. 
 This GUI was crammed and finished in about 20 hours, which is not bad for not knowing anything about them before attempting it. 
 I'm very proud of it
 
 # Details:
 This application simulates a terminal used by a health insurance company, Chocoholics Anonymous.  
 There are 3 users who can access the terminal: Managers, Providers, and Operators.  
 All these users must log in with a user ID and that ID's corresponding password, this input is then compared to a database to authenticate and let the user's have access. 

Completely functional for the scope of the project
 
 
 ~~If for some reason you want to look at this, clone and open in eclipse. This repository should have all dependencies necessary to just open it and have no errors~~
 My mistake, you will need to have JavaFX runtime, I do not know how to include it within the lib/ yet, working on it
